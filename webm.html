                                        modern town of Kom Gieif in Etay Al Baroud. Naucratis was founded as a Greek trading post in the
                                        7th century BCE, during the Late Period of ancient Egypt. It was the only Greek settlement
                                        permitted to operate in Egypt during this time, serving as a key hub for Greek traders and
                                        merchants.<br>

                                        pottery.

                                    <P>The rosetta stone was discovered in 1799 during the restoration process of the Citadel of Qaitbay
                                        , the Rosetta Stone was discovered by French soldiers under the command of French Captain
                                        Pierre-François Bouchard .
                                        The famous Rosetta Stone was discovered in the southwestern tower of that castle. That campaign
                                        might have already discovered at that time the key to the history of the Pharaonic civilization
                                        “Ancient Egypt History” and then knew its importance in history until we reached the secret of
                                        the most important and greatest ancient civilization that humanity had known until our present
                                        time and throughout the ages.
                                    </P>

                                    <P>Because of the triumph of the British troops over the French in Egypt during 1801, the stone came
                                        under British possession with the Capitulation of Alexandria.
                                        And it was transported to London, where since 1802 it has been exhibited in the British Museum,
                                        with the important title of being the most visited piece in the place.<br>
                                        But the Rosetta Museum in Rashid (Rosetta) hosts a remarkably detailed replica of the Rosetta
                                        Stone. Far from being “just a copy,” this replica is a symbolic centerpiece that connects
                                        visitors to one of the greatest discoveries in history.

                                    <h1>The hestorical significance</h1>
                                    <P>the Rosetta Stone has served as a key to unlocking the mysteries of the ancient Egyptian language
                                        and culture. It is black basalt stone with inscriptions in three different scripts: Egyptian
                                        hieroglyphs, Egyptian Demotic script, and ancient Greek. <br>
                                        The significance of the Rosetta Stone lies in its multi-lingual inscriptions. The same text was
                                        written in three different scripts, allowing scholars to compare the known Greek text with the
                                        previously unreadable Egyptian hieroglyphs. This provided scholars with a starting point to
                                        decipher and understand the ancient Egyptian language.
                                        After studying the Rosetta Stone for several years, Champollion successfully deciphered the
                                        ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in 1822.<br>
                    
                                        Through the Rosetta Stone, we have learned about the powerful pharaohs, the complex religious
                                        beliefs, the detailed hieroglyphic writing system, and the importance of rituals in ancient
                                        Egyptian society. It has allowed us to understand their construction techniques, farming
                                        practices, and medical knowledge. The Rosetta Stone has truly served as a window into the rich
                                        and fascinating world of the ancient Egyptians.

                                            the founder of Christian monasticism” in 360 AD.
                                            it is considered one of the most

                                            the world, since it dates back to the end of the fourth century (around 374
                                            AD)and was established by Saint Bishoy the Great. It is one of the four main
                                            monasteries in Wadi El Natrun, which acquired the status of sanctification in
                                            Christianity because it is among the most important cities in which the Holy
                                            Family took shelter during their visit to Egypt. After the visit of the Holy
                                            Family to the Wadi El-Natrun desert, that area became full of monasteries full
                                            of monks.

                                            amongst clergymen and scholars around the world. Although the monastery’s
                                            foundations date back to around 575 AD, it is known as the Monastery of the
                                            Syrians because of a group of al-Surian monks who settled in wadi El Natrun
                                            from the 8th to the 14th.
